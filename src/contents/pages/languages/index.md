title: My Preferred Languages

today those are the programming languages that i use more:

* VIML for my editor
* Ruby for website and managing with database relational: MySql e Postgres
* Node.js for website realtime or high traffic
* Stylus to write my css
* Slim o Jade to write my html
* Coffee Script to write javascript
* RubyMotion/MacRuby and Object-C to develope applications OSX/iOS native

## VIM: THE BEST EDITOR

I storngly believe VIM is the best editor for whom wonts to develop, maybe is not prompt as 
[SublimeText](http://sublimetext.com) or the good dated [TextMate](http://macromates.com), but considering 
the time we can gain coding in VIM and the fantastic support fo pluging and syntax really well done I would consider this as the best.

Some others coders prefer to use [MacVIM](http://code.google.com/p/macvim) and I personally don't understand this choise,
because one of the best thing about VIM is from its integration with the console.

For example: `:!git commit` could seriously annoy your **gvim**

With few and simple tricks it is possible to use just the mouse (if there is anyone would use it),
share the clipboard with the system one...

## Ruby: THE BEST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

I worked with Ruby since earlier days and I harldy believe that it is definitelly the best language ever.
Sure it is not yet perfect, it is **semi** perfect :), but from 1.9 to 2.0 it improves a lot.

There is a foundamental observaton to make, because it is a mistake under my poit of view that anyone try to find lost performances
in previos release and a support for a good **multithreading** or **multiprocessing**. 
I'm aware for such things there are proper languages: Node, Erlang or Scala...

So if it would be possible to avoid to run in terms of RAM at least 100 MB an application Rails
it could be the perfect language, perfect in its field.

## Node: Fast and mmm

It could be not right but I think that Node it is not fast

API are really precise, concise and well structured, maybe too much minimal, 
but I can tell that the big problem in this case is Javascript.

I like Javascript, I always used it, but like me much more people in the Node world find unfortunatelly 
**npm** module incorrect or even tricky **abbandonware**.

Antoher important thing is that callback by callback Node becames unreadable, 
although it has been solved partially by Ice Coffee.

Obviusly there are several usefull tools as techniques of **series**,
**waterfall** or the **parallel** processing.

Actually few coders use it, and when they do, the code is really tough t read.

## Stylus, Jade, Slim and Coffee

I believe that those are the _syntax for the futire_, as Ruby is the language for the future.
I worked as manager and coordinator in team work and I'm aware that time is money and the more fast we can write code
avoiding error and repetitions as `function(){}` the better it is. It could be the way to create light applications,
with better performances, more readable, and in teally shor time.

I chose those among of the myriad of alternatives but basically they are all similar for syntax, which is very Ruby orinted

What do you think about it?
