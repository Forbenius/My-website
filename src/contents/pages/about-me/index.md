title: Me, me and my Story

Hey there, this is Davide D&apos;Agostino, born in Italy, some day during 1983.

I have been passionate about coding since I was 8. In the really early day I was incredibly annoying my uncle  
to get his PC-128, and from there I moved my fist steps in coding world, provided with a Basic manual, which I studied as it was a bible for me.


I struggled reading that book about _basic_ because first it was about coding, which was the first time I ever seen, 
and even because it was in english, a language I actually never though it was existing before then.

My self-studies about english and _basic_ have been one of the most important reason I felt in love with **United States of America**
During that time we got in Italy a lead computing company named Olivetti, and I early understood the importance of computing and coding,
and that the very big development of it would have happened in US.

Meanwhile it was ramping up the success of [commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64)
I was much more oriented to get the amazing [amiga 500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500)
which with its [workbench](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workbench_(AmigaOS)) was revolutionary and historical
much more then **Mac OS** or **Windows 3.11**.

After my training time through the using of l'Amiga 500, 600 e 1200 I started to get more involved into PC world, 
creating something much more oriented on coding and web.

It was in the early 90es when my school tried to develope and seed with a local company a project about a radio internet,
partially made in _multicast_ part in _broadcast_.

It was one of the very first experiment in the world about develope contents **on demand**. It was historical and anticipated years before
the way the web radio and **tv** got success in content delivering in our modern time, thanks to modern speed brodcasting service.

I _gratuated_ in 2002 at TCS [Gino Zappa](http://www.itczappa.it/wp3/chi-siamo-2/)
as _technical commercial expert and programmer_.

Despite Italy has been a lead country in computing field in the really early years, 
it didn't keep its leadership meanwhile everything was moving and developing so fast in America. 
Lack of important university center in italy about programming and coding pushed me to be a _self-edcated_ young programmer.

During high school I was more involved to study and develope specific programming languages rather then school subjects:


* PHP
* .NET
* Java
* C, C++

**php** became soon my multi tool language to paly with the web. I soon got pretty interested in 
[vbulletin](https://www.vbulletin.com) forums. Unwillingly I developed for _windows_ platforms, 
despite my love for linux (I was a rehat fun), programming and creating desktop application in
Visualbasic, C# and Java, although Java's support for `gui` programming was not good at it 
and was actually work for the same scope of VB and C#. 
Java was and still is a language to develop application for `multiplattforms` but who has knowledge with the matter knows perfectly
how difficult was to develop something good enough for all the OS.

Different was for **C/C++** and **Assembler**. I used it to recoding (I'm sure i shouldn't say it) paytv decoder's **PIC**
or to create little _not malware_ applications, some innocuous keylogger 
that got so famous to have the honour of being in lead antivirus company's list. I beg pardon but I was just 13.

## 1째 Job, 1 year at IRPE as Software Sales

It was the very first job in a company I aver accepted as **Software Sales**. [IRPE](http://www.irpe.it) enstablished in __Varese__ 
was a lead multinationl italian compamy in informatic multiservices. One of the reason I accepted the jop, a part from the good salary,
was the fact they were the first company to import **Apple** computers.

it was historical for me, I really liked that job, and I got the chance to work with important clients and customer:

* [Governo Italiano](http://www.governo.it)
* [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int/esaCP/index.html)
* [Sole 24 ore](http://www.ilsole24ore.com)

I met important people there and I never going to be enough thenkfull with **Laura Baratella** to have trained, 
formed and adressed in the right direction in a such enviroment where I was working, full of professional and competitive people.

## 2째 job, 2 years at IRPE as systems analyst and programmer.

At my second year at IRPE I got an offer to change my position and 
I was addressed to a collaboration with others Java developpers to different projects,
which it turn out my **really** first great experience of team work.

## 3째 job, 3 years at Europ Assistance (Generali Group)

IRPE started to get some financial problems and situation at work got worst month by month. 
I quit the job and start another experience at Europ Assistance as **.net** programmer (but pleas don't tell it to mum)
on complex system about call center for clients like:

* [Generali](http://www.generali.com)
* [BMW](http://www.bmw.com)
* [Comune di Milano](http://www.comune.milano.it)

## 4째 Job, 6 years at LipsiaSOFT

Durnig 2006, thanks to a lucky meeting with a guy met on my _forum_ (... vbulletin remember it? :D),
we cofounded a succesfull **web agency**

There is a particular reason why I decided to start my own business and cofounding my first company. 
During my job experiences I noticed companies in Italy were in late on new technologies and programming field, meanwhile
the market started to develop new progamming languages as for example [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org). 
As long as developement and programming would have kept on Java or PHP it was stil fair enough, 
but in italy during 2005 companies stuck sitll on [visual basic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic) or [asp.net](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET).
I love new technologies and new programming way, I would worlk with this and I decided that was time to start my own company.

Lipsia Soft was one of the really fist company in Italy to use exlusively [Apple Computers](http://apple.com)
and was the really first to use the new programming language [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) and obviously 
[Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).

At Lipsia a part from development of hundreds of web site, which part of them you can see [here](http://www.lipsiasoft.com/it/portfolio) and 
[here](/pages/my-web-sites/), I personally give lots of contributions developing tens of plugins [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).
The most famous among of those:

* [LipsiADMIN](https://github.com/daddye/lipsiadmin)
* [Exception Notifiers](https://github.com/DAddYE/exception-notifier)
* [LightBOX](https://github.com/DAddYE/lightbox)

Afterword I really not appreciated  the merge of [Merb](http://www.merbivore.com), though I decided in collaboration with 
other guys to develop a new brand framework we called [Padrino](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework), 
which use much less **RAM** rather then Rails giveing a busting to the performances, more o r less 4x times faster.

More references are at the page [why](http://www.padrinorb.com/pages/why) and to follow my personl support to the project 
here is some more in details [my projects](http://localhost:3000/pages/projects/)

## MISO project

Thanks to Padrino Framework I met one of my best friend [Nathan Esquenazi](https://github.com/nesquena), 
and thanks to him i got an amazing chance to work and live in the city that I personally define my **home**, to San Francisco.

I worked in that amazing city for 1 month as coder consulting at [miso](http://gomiso.com), 
a start up which got founding from Google Venture Capitals.

During that last experince I understood **USA** was my place, and San Francisco was the right palce for me, full of programmers, 
coding camp, bar camp, conference every where.

San Francisco definitelly is the palce where I want to leave and work.

## Today

today _2012-08-01_ I make my exit from the company I cofaunded **LipsiaSOFT** because it's time to come back home.
