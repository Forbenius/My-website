Padrino is a project born several years ago, through a collaboration with [Nathan Esquenazi](https://github.com/nesquena).
It is a framework based on Sinatra to improve dramatically the website and application development.

I worked about:

* Core
* Logger
* Interfaccia Admin

I'm still working on this project because the community of ruby programmers is showing high interest.
It allowed me to improve me skills as coder ad as _coordinator_ in a competitive and exigent environment.
