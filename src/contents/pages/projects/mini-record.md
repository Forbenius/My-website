MiniRecord is a micro extension for our ActiveRecord gem. With MiniRecord you can add the ability
to create columns outside the default schema.rb, directly in your model in a similar way that
should know in others projects like DataMapper, MongoMapper or MongoID.

During years I understand that for simple websites, webservices or also rapid prototyping a fast
simple and secure way is more comfortable than weird migrations.

Relax, keep it simple: my life motive.
